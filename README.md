# Attentive IOS SDK

The Attentive IOS SDK provides the functionality to render Attentive creative units in IOS mobile applications.


## Installation

The attentive-ios-sdk is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install the SDK in a separate project using Cocoapods, include the pod in your application’s Podfile:

```
target ‘MyApp’ do
  pod ‘attentive-ios-sdk’
end
```

And then make sure to run:

```
pod install
```

Additionally, if a new version of the SDK is available, it can be updated using:
```
pod update attentive-ios-sdk
```

## Usage
See the [Example Project](https://github.com/attentive-mobile/attentive-ios-sdk/tree/main/Example) for a sample of how the Attentive
IOS SDK is used.


### Initialize the SDK

The code snippets and examples below assume you are working in Objective C. To make the SDK available, you need to import the header
file after installing the SDK:
```objectiveC
#import "attentive_ios_sdk/attentive-ios-sdk-umbrella.h"
```

```objectiveC
// Initialize the SDK with your attentive domain, in production mode
ATTNSDK *sdk = [[ATTNSDK alloc] initWithDomain:@"myCompanyDomain"];

// Alternatively, initialize the SDK in debug mode for more information about your creative and filtering rules
ATTNSDK *sdk = [[ATTNSDK alloc] initWithDomain:@"myCompanyDomain" mode:@"debug"];
```

### Identify information about the current user

Register any identifying information you have about the user with the Attentive SDK. The more identifiers you provide, the better the
SDK will function. This method can be called any time you have new information to attribute to the user.

```objectiveC
[sdk identifyWithUserIdentifiers:@{ @"clientUserId": @"myAppUserId", @phone: @"+15556667777"}];
```

See the [`ATTNUserIdentifiers`](Creative/ATTNUserIdentifiers.h) object for all possible identifier types.


### Load and render the creative

```objectiveC
[sdk trigger:self.view];
```

### Clear the current user

If the user logs out then the current user identifiers should be deleted:

```objectiveC
[sdk clearUser];
```

When/if the user logs back in, `identify` should be called again with the user's identfiers
